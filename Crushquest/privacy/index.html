  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>At CrushQuest, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our app.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> When you create an account, we may collect details such as your name, email address, phone number, and profile information.</li>

    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you interact with the app, including messages, matches, and other app activities.</li>
    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> With your permission, we may collect location data to show nearby matches.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and improve our services, including matching you with other users.</li>
    <li>To communicate with you regarding your account, updates, or support inquiries.</li>
    <li>To enhance app functionality and analyze usage trends.</li>
    <li>To ensure safety and prevent fraud or abuse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your data only in the following cases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With other users as part of the appâ€™s core functionality (e.g., showing your profile to potential matches).</li>
    <li>With service providers who assist us in operating the app (e.g., hosting and analytics).</li>
    <li>If required by law or to protect the rights, property, or safety of CrushQuest, our users, or others.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Your Privacy Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can update or delete your profile information in the app settings.</li>
    <li>You can withdraw consent for location sharing via your device settings.</li>
    <li>You can deactivate your account at any time if you no longer wish to use the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement industry-standard measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>6. Retention of Information</h2>
  <p>We retain your data as long as your account is active. Messages older than 50 in history and messages older than 6 months are not stored on our servers. If you delete your account, your personal data will be removed, except where retention is required by law.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be communicated to you through the app or email. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>
