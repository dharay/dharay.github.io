          may collect necessary device and Account information to accurately
          provide 'pro' services to subscribed users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The images created by users are stored in app itself, some images are
          stored temporarily while some, as chosen by user are saved on disk.
        </p>
        <h2>Deletion of data</h2>
        <p>
          Temporary images are deleted periodically. Images stored on disk are
          available for users to delete from options on homepage. Uninstallation
          of app will ensure deletion of all locally stored data. Data related
          to purchases are needed for serving active subscriptions and cannot be
          deleted.
